    "# Installation Instructions for MacOS\n",
    "\n",
    "This document will walk you through the steps you need to perform to install and configure **Jupyter Lab**, the development software you will use for CS220.  You need to perform these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Install pixi\n",
    "2. Set up pixi for CS220\n",
    "3. Launch Jupyter Lab to test the installation\n",
    "4. Download course projects (Project 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Install Pixi\n",
    "\n",
    "[Pixi](https://pixi.prefix.dev/latest/) is a lightweight environment manager used to install Python and all required libraries in a consistent way. Either use the commands provided below, or in a browser go to Pixi's [installation](https://pixi.prefix.dev/latest/installation/) page to install the software. At the very top of the page, Pixi will show installation commands for different operating systems. Before copying a command, make sure you know which operating system you are using. If you are using MacOS, copy the command under the \"MacOS\" section. It should look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | sh\n",
    "```\n",
    "Next, open the Terminal application on your Mac. You can find it by opening Spotlight using Cmd+Space shortcut\n",
    "\n",
    "![Spotlight](images/spotlight.png) \n",
    "\n",
    "and then typing \"Terminal\" to search for it in the spotlight search bar. Click on the Terminal icon <img alt=\"terminal logo\" src=\"images/terminal_logo.png\" width=\"30px\"> to open it or press enter. This will look something like this in spotlight search: \n",
    "\n",
    "![Spotlight terminal search](images/spotlight-terminal.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you prefer, you can also open the Terminal by going to the launchpad <img alt=\"Launchpad logo\" src=\"images/launchpad.png\" width=\"30px\">, clicking on the \"Other\" folder and then clicking on the Terminal icon \n",
    "<img alt=\"terminal logo\" src=\"images/terminal_logo.png\" width=\"30px\">.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the terminal, paste the command you copied from the Pixi installation page and press Enter. If you encounter any permission issues, you may need to prepend `sudo ` (so the command becomes `sudo curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | sh`) to the command to run it with superuser privileges. You will be prompted to enter your machine's password to proceed with the installation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the installation is complete, you will need to restart your terminal for the changes to take effect. You can do this by closing the terminal window and opening a new one. After restarting the terminal, you can verify that Pixi was installed correctly by typing the following command in the terminal and pressing Enter:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pixi --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If Pixi was installed correctly, you should see the version number of Pixi printed in the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Setting up Pixi for CS220\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin working on the course projects, it is good practice to set up a dedicated folder for all the material related to the course. This will keep your work organized and make it easier to find your files later on. For this, right-click on your Desktop and create a new folder called `cs220` on your `Desktop`. You can do this by navigating to the `Desktop`, right-clicking in an empty space, and selecting \"New Folder\" from the context menu. Name the new folder `cs220`. You can name the folder whatever you like or place it anywhere, but make sure to remember where you created it and what you named it, as you will need to navigate to this folder in the terminal later on.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can start using Pixi for CS220, we need to set up a configuration file that tells Pixi which version of Python and which packages we need for the course. We have created a configuration file that will do all this for you automatically. You can download the configuration file from this link: [pixi.toml](../pixi.toml). After downloading the file, move it to the `cs220` folder you just created. You can do this by dragging and dropping the file into the folder in Finder.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color: red; font-weight: bold;\">\n",
    "Do not edit the pixi configuration file or change its name otherwise you may encounter issues when trying to set up the environment or place it anywhere else. It should be named <code>pixi.toml</code> and be located inside the <code>cs220</code> folder (or whatever you named it).\n",
    "</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, go back to the Terminal application. In the terminal, you will need to navigate to the `cs220` folder you created earlier. You can do this by using the `cd` command followed by the path to the folder. For example, if you created the folder on your Desktop, you would type the following command and press Enter:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd ~/Desktop/cs220\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do not remember the exact path to the folder, you can also type `cd ` (with a space after `cd`), then drag and drop the `cs220` folder from the Finder into the terminal window. This will automatically fill in the correct path for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Terminal cd drag and drop](images/drag-drop-terminal.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also drag and drop the `cs220` folder onto the terminal icon in the Dock to open a new terminal window that is already navigated to that folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Terminal dock drag and drop](images/drag-drop-dock.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to know the exact path to the `cs220` folder, you can always hold down the `Option` key while right-clicking on the folder in the Finder, and then select \"Copy [folder name] as Pathname\" from the context menu. You can then paste this path into the terminal after the `cd ` command.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you placed the folder somewhere else or named it differently, make sure to adjust the command accordingly to match the correct path to your `cs220` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "After navigating to the folder, you can verify that you are in the correct location by typing the following command in the terminal and pressing Enter:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pwd\n",
    "```\n",
    "This command will print the current working directory in the terminal. Make sure it matches the path to the `cs220` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color: red; font-weight: bold;\">\n",
    "Note: For the rest of this document, and throughout the course, make sure you are always inside the <code>cs220</code> folder (or whatever folder you named it) when running Pixi commands. Pixi relies on the configuration file in this folder, and commands will not work correctly if run elsewhere.\n",
    "</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you are in the correct folder, you can use Pixi to set up the Python environment for CS220 using the configuration file you downloaded earlier. Type the following command in the terminal and press Enter:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pixi install\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command will create a new Pixi environment based on the configuration file and install all the necessary packages for the course. The first time you run this command, it may take a few minutes to download and install everything. It will create a new file `pixi.lock` and a new folder `.pixi` in the `cs220` folder. Since the `.pixi` folder is a hidden folder (as its name begins with a dot), it will not be visible in the Finder by default. So do not worry if you do not see it. As long as the `pixi.lock` file exists, you are good to go. If you still want to verify the presence of the `.pixi` folder, you can use the `ls -a` command in the terminal or use the shortcut Cmd+Shift+Dot to reveal hidden files in the Finder. It is important that you do not edit these files and folders generated by Pixi, remove them or change their names otherwise you may encounter issues when trying to set up the environment. If you accidentally do end up changing these somehow, simply remove these completely and run the pixi install command again from the `cs220` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Launching Jupyter Lab to Test the Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "After the installation is complete and you have navigated to the correct folder, you can start Jupyter Lab by running the following command in the same terminal window:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pixi run jupyterlab\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    " If pixi is installed correctly and the environment is set up properly, JupyterLab will open an interactive window directly in your default browser. You can use the files sidebar on the left side to navigate to the files you want to open. We recommend that you use Chrome (or any Chromium based browser like Brave/Arc) as your default browser for the best experience. If you do not want to change your default browser to Chrome, you can also copy the URL that JupyterLab provides in the terminal (it should look something like `http://localhost:8888/lab?token=...`) and paste it into Chrome manually instead of your default browser which may be Firefox/Safari or another browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![JupyterLab startup](./images/jupyter.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Later on when you open up the project files, you may be asked to choice a \"kernel\" for the Jupyter Notebook you are working in. Just use the dropdown menu to choose `Python 3 (ipykernel)`\n",
    "\n",
    "![Kernel choice](./images/kernel_choice.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Downloading Course Projects (Project 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "While you can always download project files manually as ZIP files from the course assignments page, and manually extract and place them in your `cs220/projects` folder, you can also use Pixi to download the CS220 project files to automate this process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before downloading a project this way, make sure that the Terminal is open and that you are currently inside the `cs220` folder you created earlier. If you are unsure whether you are in the correct location, you can navigate to the folder again by using any of the methods described in Step 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can confirm that you are in the correct directory by running:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pwd\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The output should end with `cs220`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you are in the correct directory, to download Project 1, type the following command in the Terminal and press Enter:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pixi run get_project p1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command will automatically download the Project 1 files, create a new folder for the project, and extract all required files into that folder. If this is the first time you are downloading Project 1, the folder will be named `p1`. If a folder named `p1` already exists, Pixi will instead create a folder named `p1-2`, `p1-3`, and so on. This behavior is intentional and helps ensure that your existing work is not overwritten. Once the command finishes running, you should see a message in the Terminal indicating where the downloaded project files are located. For example, once you run the command above, you might see a message like this in the Terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "Your project is placed at : /Users/<username>/Desktop/cs220/projects/p1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the project files have been downloaded and extracted into a new folder named `p1` inside your `cs220/projects` folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "After downloading the project, you can start JupyterLab by running the following command in the same terminal window:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pixi run jupyterlab\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When JupyterLab opens in your web browser, use the file browser on the left side to navigate to the newly created `p1` (or `p1-2`) folder and open the notebook file provided for Project 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "For future projects, you can use similar commands (for example, `pixi run get_project p2`). Each project will be downloaded into its own separate folder inside `cs220/projects`.\n",
