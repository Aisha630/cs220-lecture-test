Therefore, she is seeking funds from Kiva lenders to buy farm inputs such as good fertilizer and good-quality seeds. Through this loan, Ester should double her production, and this will translate into increased income. She then intends to save more money in the future so that she can develop her farming.<br /><br />One objective that Juhudi Kilimo aims at fulfilling is increasing the ease of accessing farm inputs and income-generating assets for farmers.
